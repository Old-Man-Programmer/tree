Version 2.2.0 (11/24/2024)
  - Add option --opt-toggle which turns on the ability to toggle options such
    as -a, -p, etc.  Useful to add to an alias for turning an option off when
    using said alias. (Christoph Anton Mitterer)
  - Add --hyperlink option to print OSC 8 terminal hyperlinks for files. Also
    adds the --scheme and --authority options to modify the schema and hostname/
    authority of the links. (Nicolai Dagestad)
    OSC 8 Terminal hyperlinks:
      https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda
  - Maybe finally fix JSON error reporting when unable to open a directory and a
    full tree is required, such as when using --du. (Alchemyst@github)
  - Fix small rounding error in human readable size (-h) output, where 9.99K is
    rounded to 10.0K rather than 10K (Ivan Ivanovich)
  - Fix the totals report for sizes when --du option is used.  The directory
    size total was correct, but the final report was an accumulation of all
    the directory totals rather than just the top most directory total.
    (Alchemyst@github)
  - Add .gitignore file to distribution for those wanting that. (Kenta Arai)
  - Add 'none' as a valid --sort option (i.e. -U).
  - Add ability to cross compile for Android (freemedom@github)
  - List charsets again if --charsets is not given an argument.
  - Allow --help and usage to use ANSI bold and italic if colorization is
    enabled.
  - General code cleanups:
    - Removed unused externs where possible.
    - Clean up some warnings issued by -Wextra (Kenta Arai)
    - Update Makefile to allow CC and the CFLAGS -O3 option to be overridden,
      move CPPFLAGS into their own variable, add -Wstrict-prototypes
      (David Seifert)
    - Long over-due move to stdbool.h, removes custom bool type and changes all
      occurrences of TRUE/FALSE to true/false. (David Seifert / others)  This
      likely makes C99+ even more of a requirement now. Please let me know if
      this requires a work-around for your system.
    - Went ahead and added -Wconversion to the Makefile as well. This required a
      large number of type conversion fixing which may have unexpected side
      effects, but should hopefully help with tree safely dealing with absurd
      sizes/number of things in the future as this promotes using size_t more.
      This probably needs more work to do properly however.
    - Apply the const constraint on parameter strings wherever possible.

Version 2.1.3 (07/09/2024)
  - Mostly a brown-paper bag release to fix the below regression and add a
    feature I forgot to add.
  - Fix regression in search() function that broke --fromfile (Florian Ernst)
    (caused by removing too much code while fixing premature sort for
    --fromfile)
  - Allow the -L option to accept its parameter immediately (with no space)
    instead of requiring it be the next option word. (Trevor Gross)

Version 2.1.2 (07/01/2024)
  - Fix issue where --gitignore does not think a pattern with a singular
    terminal '/' (indicating it matches only directories,) is a relative path.
    (Clinton)
  - Don't emit the error 'recursive, not followed' if when using -L, the depth
    would prevent descending anyway. This also fixes up a JSON output error 
    (missing comma) when this happens. (simonpmind)
  - Don't prematurely sort files/directories with --from*file. (gitlab @jack6th)
  - Various seg-faults fixed (Hanqin Guan (The OSLab of Peking University)):
    - Make doubly sure that there is actually a previous path entry when reading
      from a tabbed file.
    - Make sure there is actually a file entity when applying the link info to
      it when reading fromfile using --fflinks.
    - Increase space for the path a little in listdir(), just to be sure.
    - Make sure that there is no topsort (--dirsfirst / --filesfirst) if there
      is no basesort (-U).
    - Make sure gittrim() function can handle a null string.
  - Update email address to steve.baker.llc@gmail.com from ice@mama.indstate.edu
    which has been permanently disabled.

Version 2.1.1 (05/31/2023)
  - Various spelling corrections.
  - Fix issue where following links while doing JSON output would lead to
    incorrect JSON output. (simonpmind)
  - Fix issue where .info patterns relative to the .info file that did not use
    a wildcard for matching the prefix were not matching files properly.
    (German Lashevich)
  - Added support for making trees from tab indented files (--fromtabfile)
    (gitlab @AvidSeeker), also cleaned up some other issues in the fromfile
    code.
  - Fix buffer overflow in listdir() when file names are allowed to be longer
    than 256 characters (like when using fromfile.) (Javier Jaramago Fernández)
  - If when attempting to open a .gitignore or .info file from a top level
    directory and failing, recursively check the parents for such a file.  This
    stops when successful at opening such a file. This behavior might in the
    future be modified to open all such files in all parents to until root is
    reached. (Damien Bezborodov) Note that this requires the use of realpath()
    which I think may be an issue for some OSes.
  - Fix issue where tree would never descend (-l) a symbolic link when a full
    tree is gathered (--du/matchdirs/prune) (gitlab @6ramr)

Version 2.1.0 (12/26/2022)
  This is a bit bigger release, due to not realizing that gitlab/github was
  not sending me email and ice+tree@mama.indstate.edu was broken.  This has
  been fixed and I think I have gone through most all of the outstanding issues
  that were submitted over the last few months.  Note to those that are sending
  me git merge requests: because I distribute this in multiple ways and places,
  and I tend to manually go over patches and often re-work them in any event, I
  will not likely ever directly accept any merge requests. I will still use the
  patch information from them for inclusion into the code, so you are more than
  welcome to still submit such merges.
  - Add support for --info and --gitignore for the --fromfile option.
    (Suggested by Piotr Andruszkow)
  - Add options --infofile and --gitfile to load .info and .gitignore files
    explicitly.  Each implies --info or --gitignore respectively.
  - Add NULL guard for json_printinfo() and xml_printinfo() (and fix ftype
    printing for XML) (Kenta Arai)
  - Fix getcharset() to not return a getenv() pointer (fix for ENV34-C issue.)
    (Kenta Arai)
  - Another attempt at fixing extraneous /'s in HTML URLs/output. (Sebastian
    Rose)
  - Fixed XML output (Dave Rice)
  - Remove the (very outdated) French version of the manpage.  Look to
    localization projects such as Debian's 'manpages-l10n' for localized
    translations. (hmartink)
  - Add support for the NO_COLOR environment variable (https://no-color.org/).
    Equivalent to the -n option (can be still be overridden with -C).
    (Timm Fitschen)
  - Removed many C99isms to enable compiling on C90 compilers with fewer
    warnings.  (Sith Wijesinghe and Matthew Sessions)  It should not be
    necessary to avoid using a standard that is old enough to drink,
    furthermore it is all but impossible to remove the remaining warnings and
    have modern features like compound literals. In the meantime I've added
    -std=c11 to the default CFLAGS for Linux and will likely not worry about
    C90 compatibility going forward unless there is some other reason for it.
  - Added a helper function for long command line arguments to clean up option
    processing (and fixes the processing for a few of the options such as
    --timefmt= (наб?).)
  - Added --hintro and --houtro options to select files to use as the HTML
    intro and outro.  Use /dev/null or an empty file to eliminate them
    entirely.  This should make it much easier to create your own custom CSS
    or embed one or more trees into a web page.
  - Defer printing the version until the character set is known so we can use
    the linedraw copyright symbol.
  - Revert change to the error code to not return an error (code 2) when
    attempting to list a non-directory that actually exists.  Tree will still
    return an error when attempting to list a non-existing directory/file.
  - Added option --fflinks which will process symbolic link information from
    a file generated with 'tree -if --noreport' when using --fromfile.
    (Suggested by Chentao Credungtao)
  - Updated the totals reporting code to also include in the total the file or
    directory that is being listed.  This should make a correct report when
    doing something like 'tree *'.

Version 2.0.4 (09/06/2022)
  - Brown paper bag release:
    - Fix missing comma in JSON output. (jogbear?)

Version 2.0.3 (08/26/2022)
  - Fix segfault when filelimit is used and tree encounters a directory it
    cannot enter. (Kenta Arai)
  - Use += when assigning CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in the Makefile allowing
    them to be modified by environment variables during make. (Ben Brown)
    Possibly assumes GNU make.
  - Fixed broken -x option (stops recursing.) (balping)
  - Fix use after free (causing segfault) for dir/subdir in list.c (Erik
    Skultety / Ben Brown)
  - Fixes for .gitignore functionality (Saniya Maheshwari / Mig-hub ? / Carlos
    Pinto)
    - Fixed * handing in patmatch. Worked almost like ** before, now properly
      stops at /'s.  These issues were the result of forgetting that patmatch()
      was just to match filenames to patterns, not paths.
    - Patterns starting with / are actually relative to the .gitignore file,
      not the root of the filesystem, go figure.
    - Patterns without /'s in .gitignore apply to any file in any directory
      under the .gitignore, not just the .gitignore directory
  - Remove "All rights reserved" from copyright statements.  A left-over from
    trees original artistic license.
  - Add in --du and --prune to --help output (Nxueyamao?)
  - Fixed segfault when an unknown directory is given with -X
  - Fixed output up for -X and -J options.
  - Remove one reference to strnlen which isn't necessary since it may not
    be available on some OS's.

Version 2.0.2 (02/16/2022)
  - Okay, apparently the stddata addition is causing havoc (who knew how many
    scripts just haphazardly hand programs random file descriptors, that's
    surely not a problem.)  Going forward the stddata option will only work
    if the environment variable STDDATA_FD is present or set to the descriptor
    to produce the JSON output on.
  - Fix HTML url output issue. (Maxim Cournoyer)  It was definitely broken in
    the 2.0.0 release, and this should normalize it with respect to older
    versions, however I think it needs to be updated to work better.
  - Update MANPATH for OS X (Michiel Beijen)
  - Fixed an error with * in the patchmatch code where *foo*bar would match
    *foo alone. (Josey Smith)

Version 2.0.1 (01/03/2022)
  - Simplify Makefile and the following changes: prefix -> PREFIX,
    BINDIR -> DESTDIR, -O4 -> -O3, mode 644 for man page installation
    (Michal Vasilek)
  - Make patterns ending in '/' match directories (but not files) for -I / -P
    (Michiel Beijen) should also fix issues with --gitignore as well
    (Taylor Faubion)
  - Fix --gitignore not matching files relative to the path of the .gitignore
    (Taylor Faubion)  I did say it was hacked together.
  - Refactored color.c a bit to simplify the code as a prelude to meta coloring.

Version 2.0.0 (12/21/2021)
  - This started out as a 1.9.0 release but then I got fed up with the
    abundance of directory listers (8 in total, 2 each for each output mode).
    Nothing is terribly well tested since there are a lot of changes and I would
    like to get this out the door finally, please report breakage.  This reduced
    so much code that all the below additions only resulted in a code base that
    is only 54 lines larger than 1.8.0.
  - Rolled all the directory listers into 2 functions that call output specific
    functions (removes one TODO).
  - -R option now recursively calls the emit_tree() function rather than using
    system() to re-call tree.  Also removes a TODO.
  - Adds --info to print information about files/directories from information
    found in .info files (removes a maybe do) In HTML output, comments show as
    mouse over tooltips, which I imagine will be the most useful use of this
    "feature".
  - Output un-indented JSON on file descriptor 3 ("stddata") automatically if
    file descriptor 3 is present (currently Linux only.) Maybe switch to BSON.
  - Always HTML escape filenames in HTML output even when -C is used.
    (Eric Pruitt)
  - Return a non-zero exit status if there is a failure to open any directory.
  - Added --gitignore option to filter out files specified by .gitignore files.
    (also reads $GIT_DIR/info/exclude if present.) To facilitate gitignore,
    adds support for ** on pattern matching to allow /**/ to match a single /.
    This is not well tested and kind of hacked together, so may not work
    correctly. (Jake Zimmerman and others)
  - Now also supports multiple -I and -P instances. (Michiel Beijen and others)
  - Now prints meta data for the top level directory as well.
  - Split spaghetti code in main into individual functions.
  - Properly sort --fromfile input (Chentao Credungtao via Debian)
  - Make tree colorization use reset (rs code in dir_colors,) not normal color
    when resetting attributes (Filips Romāns via Debian).
  - Honor -n (no color) even if the CLICOLOR_FORCE environment variable is set
    (Paul Seyfert)
  - Added --metafirst to print the metadata before the indentation lines
    (suggested by Richard Mitchell)
  - Fix --sort option to not require =
  - Defer sorting for --du until the entire sub-directory tree has been
    processed.
  - Optimized makefile, HP/UX support (Osipov, Michael). Note that this changes
    the prefix default to /usr/local, which is becoming required for many
    systems now.
  - Renamed (the by now very obsolete) doc/tree.1.fr to doc/tree.fr.1 (Jonas
    Stein)
  - Fix JSON string escaping such that it is not using the HTML escaping (Fox
    & others)
  - Add --filesfirst option (John A. Fedoruk). Cleaned up sorting code to make
    --dirsfirst and --filesfirst top level meta-sorts.
  - "arial" not "ariel" (Mark), HTML style-sheet cleaned up in any event.
  - Deprecate using local -DLINUX / -DCYGWIN and use the OS provided
    __linux__ or __CYGWIN__ (Jonas Stein)
  - XML/HTML/JSON output needs to be mutually exclusive, last command line
    switch wins. (Sergei Maximov)
  - Make sure we use xmalloc instead of malloc in a number of places (Tomáš
    Beránek)

Version 1.8.0 (11/16/2018)
  - Added an experimental --fromfile option (suggested by several people.)
    This may eventually be replaced or supplimented by a --fromjson option.
  - Added support for BSD's CLICOLOR and CLICOLOR_FORCE environment variables.
    (Suggested by Alyssa Ross)
  - Use strftime() exclusively when formatting date/time to respect locale.
  - Some man page fixes and cleanups curtsey of Kirill Kolyshkin
  - Update BINDIR in Makefile for MacOS X -- It is not allowed to install
    programs to /usr/bin on MacOS X any longer due to System Integrity
    Protection (SIP) (Shawn Mehan)
  - Misc patches from Jacob Wahlgren:
    - Improved command line switch error reporting.
    - Symbolic links not displayed if a -P pattern is active
    - Missing argument error reporting fixes on long format switches.
  - Fixed JSON output hanging commas (John Lane, Tad, others)
  - JSON size output ignored -h/--si flags (Wagner Camarao)
  - Fixed issue with malformed multibyte string handling. (Mantas
    Mikul&#279;nas)
  - Fixed issue where mbstowcs() fails to null terminate the string due to
    improper UTF-8 encoding leading to garbage being printed. (Nick Craig-Wood)
  - Found a bug where the wrong inode (and device) information would be printed
    for symbolic links. (Stephan Gabert)

Version 1.7.0 (04/23/2014)
  - Allow user/group names up to 32 characters before clipping.
  - Made -i compress XML and JSON output as much as possible by eliminating
    extraneous whitespace.
  - Added --caseinsensitive (renamed --ignore-case ala grep) flag so patterns
    match without regard to case, courtesy of Jason A Donenfeld.
  - Added --matchdirs option courtesy of Brian Mattern & Jason A. Donenfeld
    <Jason@zx2c4.com>.
  - Fixed possible buffer overflow on large uid/gids w/o user names/group
    names (Alexandre Wendling <alexandrerw@celepar.pr.gov.br>)
  - Added JSON support courtesy of Florian Sesser <fs@it-agenten.com>.
  - Fixed formatting error with HTML output when -L 1 specified. (Sascha Zorn 
    <sascha.zorn@gmail.com>)
  - Added file size sorting (Philipp M?ller <philippausmuensing@googlemail.com>)
  - Added '--sort[=]<name>' option, ala ls.
  - Fixed OS X makefile problems (Ryan Hollis <theryanhollis@gmail.com>)
  - Fixed possible memory overflow in read_dir (path/lbuf not equal in size
    to pathsize/lbufsize.) (Han Hui <hanhui03@163.com>)
  - Fix S_ISDOOR/S_IFDOOR spelling mistake for Solaris. (Tim Mooney
    <Tim.Mooney@ndsu.edu>)
  - Make tree more reliably detect UTF-8 locales. (Mantas Mikulnas
    <grawity@gmail.com> and others.)
  - Return non-zero exit status on option errors, print usage to stdout when
    not an error, add the posix '--' option terminator, Change -S description
    to mean CP437 (console) output codes, not ASCII. (Ivan Shmakov
    <oneingray@gmail.com>)

Version 1.6.0 (05/24/11)
  - Re-org of code into multiple files, split HTML and Unix listdir() into
    separate functions, various code cleanups and optimizations.
  - Fixed a memory leak in listdir() when memory was allocated early and not
    freed before function exit.
  - Fixed possible buffer overflow where symbolic links are followed.
  - Fixed links printing "argetm" before the name of the link when the LINK
    setting for DIR_COLORS is set to target (Markus Schnalke
    <meillo@marmaro.de>)
  - More fully support dir colors -- added support for su, sg, tw, ow, & st
    options (and "do" in theory).
  - Use the environment variable "TREE_COLORS" instead of "LS_COLORS" for
    color information if it exists.
  - Added --si flag to print filesizes in SI (powers of 1000) units (Ulrich
    Eckhardt)
  - Added -Q to quote filenames in double quotes.  Does not override -N or -q.
  - Control characters are no longer printed in carrot notation, but as
    backslashed octal, ala ls, except for codes 7-13 which are printed as
    \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f and \r respectively. Spaces and backslashes are
    also now backslashed as per ls, for better input to scripts unless -Q
    is in use (where "'s are backslashed.) (Ujjwal Kumar)
  - Added -U for unsorted listings (directory order).
  - Added -c for sorting by last status change (ala ls -c).
  - --dirsfirst is now a meta-sort and does not override -c, -v, -r or -t, but
    is disabled by -U.
  - After many requests, added the ability to process the entire tree before
    emitting output.  Used for the new options --du, which works like the du
    command: sums the amount of space under each directory and prints a total
    amount used in the report and the --prune option which will prune all empty
    directories from the output (makes the -P option output much more readable.)
    It should be noted that this will be slow to output when processing large
    directory trees and can consume copious amounts of memory, use at your own
    peril.
  - Added -X option to emit the directory tree in XML format (turns colorization
    off always.)
  - Added --timefmt option to specify the format of time display (implies -D).
    Uses the strftime format.

Version 1.5.3 (11/24/09)
  - Properly quote directories for the system command when tree is relaunched
    using the -R option.
  - Fixed possible indentation problem if dirs[*] is not properly zeroed
    (Martin Nagy).
  - Use strcoll() instead of strcmp() to sort files based on locale if set.
  - Change "const static" to "static const" to remove some compiler warnings
    for Solaris (Kamaraju Kusumanchi).
  - Actually use TREE_CHARSET if it's defined.
  - Automatically select UTF-8 charset if TREE_CHARSET is not set, and the
    locale is set to *UTF-8 (overridden with --charset option.)

Version 1.5.2.2 (01/22/09)
  - Set locale before checking MB_CUR_MAX.
  - Added HP-NonStop platform support (Craig McDaniel <craigmcd@gmail.com>)
  - Fixed to support 32 bit UID/GIDs.
  - Added Solaris build options to Makefile (edit and uncomment to use).
    Provided by Wang Quanhong

Version 1.5.2.1 (08/29/08)

  - Changed the argument to printit() to be signed char to avoid warnings.

Version 1.5.2 (06/06/08)
  - Added --filelimit X option to not descend directories that have more than
    X number of files in them.
  - Added -v option for version sorting (also called natural sorting) ala ls.

Version 1.5.1.2 (06/04/08)
  - Fixed compile issues related to MB_CUR_MAX on non-linux machines.
  - Removed unecessary features.h

Version 1.5.1.1 (06/11/07)

    option (Zurd)
  - List available charsets if --charset option is missing charset argument.
  - Fixed --charset option processing bug.
  - Fixed missing <br>'s when -i option used with -H.
  - Added -h option for human readable output.
  - Colorization bugfix for special files and directories (make tree behave as
    ls does)

Version 1.5.0 (08/15/04)
  - Added -T option to change title and H1 header in HTML output.
  - Added -r option to reverse alpha sort output, ala. 'ls -r'.
  - '|' wildcard support added by David MacMahon <davidm@astron.Berkeley.EDU>.
  - Remove extraneous '/' at the end of dirs and dir-symlinks in HTML output.
  - Removed several possible overflow problems by dynamically allocating
    arrays in several places.
  - Better support for Locales and printing utf-8 encoded characters in
    filenames (still hackish).
  - Fixed -t to alphasort files with same time-stamps.
  - Fixed encoding of filenames in HTML output, Kyosuke and others.
  - Patches by Kyosuke Tokoro <NBG01720@nifty.ne.jp>:
    - Now, runs OS/2 systems.
      + Print the file attributes in 'adhrs' format for each file, instead
        of the protections in 'drwxrwxrwx' format, when running the tree
        on OS/2 with option -p.
    - Added --charset option, to specify which character set is used for
      output.
       + You can specify any IANA registered character set name. But I have
         tested only following character sets:
               Shift_JIS       EUC-JP          IBM850
               UTF-8           ISO-8859-1      US-ASCII
       + Now, `-S' option is equal to `--charset=IBM437'.
       + When running on OS/2 systems, the default value of this option
         is according to current codepage.  On the other systems, no default.
  - Change font-weight to font-size in CSS .VERSION.
  - Change version to standard major.minor.patch format.
  - Switch from artistic license to GPLv2.

Version 1.4 (02/21/02 (b1), 03/24/02 (b2), 02/06/03 (b3))
  - Added large file support under Linux.
  - Fixed crashing on missing command line arguments.
  - Fixed several memory leaks
  - Added --dirsfirst option to list directories first.

  - Fixed bug in parse_dir_colors().
  - Changed -I to also ignore directories.
  - Added --nolinks command to turn off hyperlinks with the HTML output.
  - Fixed several memory leaks in listdir().
  - Some additional code cleanup in listdir().
  - Some systems may define TRUE/FALSE, so don't create the enums for TRUE
    and FALSE if that's the case.
  - Fixed over-allocation bug in read_dir().
  - Added crude beginnings of color output for HTML via CSS (Ted Tiberio
    ttiberio@rochester.rr.com).

  - Fixed recursive symlink detection.
  - Added --inodes and --device options.
  - Added --noreport option.

Version 1.3 (02/15/99)
  - Fixed long pathname problem by dynamically allocating the path.
  - Added recursive symlink detection.
  - Added --help and --version options.
  - When -C is used and LS_COLORS is undefined, tree uses a default color
    scheme (thus -C always forces color output now).
  - Added -S to show ASCII tree lines (Gerald Scheidl)
  - Made tree more portable (Guido Socher and others)

  Following options courtesy of Francesc Rocher:
  - Added -o <filename> to redirect the output.
  - Added -H <baseHRef> to print the tree in HTML format.
  - Added -L to set the maximum level of directories to print.
  - Added -R to recursively restart the search at the level given by `-L'
    option (adding as well `-o 00Tree.html').

Version 1.2 (01/05/97)
  - Added -D to print the date of the last modification.
  - Added -t option to sort by last modification time (ala ls -t).
  - Added -I <pattern>, similar to the -P option except tree does not print
    those files which match the pattern.
  - Made tree print non-printable characters in filenames in standard unix
    carrot notation.
  - Added -N option to make tree print filenames without any processing.
  - Added -q option to make tree print non-printable characters in filenames
    as question marks.
  - Added `|' to -F output and made it only print character type after the
    link on sym-links, not on the symlink name itself.
  - Added -u option to display username/uid, and -g option to display group
    name/gid.
  - Fully (pass the salt) implemented dircolors support.

Version 1.1 (07/09/96)
  - Made some changes to the Makefile to insure proper installation and for
    multi-architecture support and a bug-fix.
  - Made root directory colorized if dircolors is enabled.
  - Put []'s around permission and size info, 'cause I think it looks better.
  - Added -A option to enable ANSI-lines hack.
  - Added some sanity checks for dircolors support.
  - Added -P <pattern> to list only those files that match the wildcard
