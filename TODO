Should do:

- Use stdint.h and inttypes.h to standardize the int sizes and format strings.
  Not sure how cross-platform this would be.

- Add --DU option to fully report disk usage, taking into account files that
  are not displayed in the output.

- Make wide character support less of a hack.

- Fully support HTML colorization properly and allow for an external stylesheet.

- Might be nice to prune files by things like type, mode, access/modify/change
  time, uid/gid, etc. ala find.

- Just incorporate the stat structure into _info, since we now need most of
  the structure anyway.

Maybe do:

- With the addition of TREE_COLORS, add some custom options to perhaps colorize
  metadata like the permissions, date, username, etc, and change the color of
  the tree lines and so on.

- Refactor color.c.

- Output BSON on stddata instead of JSON.
